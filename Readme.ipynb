    "The bank robber algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a bank robber who's looking to rob as many banks in a day before you flee the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "You got your hands on a list of banks in the area, with their location, the amount of money they have and the time they will take to rob. It looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "id, x_coordinate, y_coordinate, money, time (hr)\n",
    "0, 11.4, 3.3, 5000, 0.6\n",
    "1, 6.9, 7.1, 15000, 0.3\n",
    "2, 1.4, 13.2, 900, 1.1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This list of banks is in `bank_data.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "You have **24 hours** to make as much money as possible then escape.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your run can start anywhere on the map but it has to end at the **helicopter escape zone**: coordinates (0,0)\n",
    "    - If you try to rob too many banks and can't get to the helicopter in 24 hours, you get caught and go to jail.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You solution is a list or array of integers (eg. `[580, 433, 24, 998]`) where the numbers are the IDs of each banks. The ID of each bank is their index (their row index).\n",
    "\n",
    "- You travel between banks at 30 km/h. You have to travel from one bank to the next!\n",
    "    - Remember the formula to calculate the distance between two points.\n",
    "    - The coordinates are in kilometers.\n",
    "        - So (1, 1) and (1, 2) are one kilometer apart. \n",
    "        - This would take 1 / 30 hour = 2 minutes to travel\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your solution should be an approximative/heuristic algorithm\n",
    "    - This problem is NP-Hard, you won't find a fast enough algorithm that has the perfect solution\n",
    "    - It doesn't need to find the best solution\n",
    "    - Find the best solution you can!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your solution has to run on a common laptop in under 3 minutes for the 10,000 cities dataset\n",
    "    - You can use everything you want to achieve this:\n",
    "        - Use numpy, pandas, functions, algorithms\n",
    "        - You can use parallelism\n",
    "        - Use optimied libraries (pandas, numba, scipy, etc.)\n",
    "    - Test your code on **small subsets** of the data so they run fast\n",
    "        - Then scale your code up to bigger chunks of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your input is a pandas dataframe with the bank data. Your output is a list of bank IDs in order that you rob them:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ex:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('bank_data.csv')\n",
    "robber_algorithm(df)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output is a list of bank IDs\n",
    "[OUTPUT] --> [664, 2341, 26, 998, 9583, 24, 1, 444, 6783]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Checking Your Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `check_solution` function from `check_solution.py` to test if your solution is valid and verify the score.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most of the design paradigms we saw in class will work for this:\n",
    "    - Divide-and-conquer\n",
    "    - Brute Force\n",
    "    - Greedy Algorithm\n",
    "    - Dynamic Programming\n",
    "    - Backtracking\n",
    "    - Breadth-first & Depth-first search\n",
    "    - Some we haven't seen:\n",
    "        - Branch & Bound\n",
    "        - Prune & Search\n",
    " \n",
    " Start with something that's easier (brute-force or greedy algorithm) and then work towards a better design once it works.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Because there are too many banks at each step, you will need to select only some candidates to explore\n",
    " \n",
    " - If you find yourself doing many **Nearest neighbors** type queries, consider using a [KD-Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree) or a Ball Tree to speed it up.\n",
    "     - There are good implementations of KD-Trees and nearest neighbours in scipy, sklearn and [this library](https://github.com/lmcinnes/pynndescent)\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can work your algorithm backwards (starting at the end and backing up to the starting point) or forwards (finding a starting point and looping until there is no time left). They will lead to different designs however\n"
